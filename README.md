# ARTNeT Advanced Workshop on Analysing Trade and Trade Policy with the Structural Gravity Model

Here are the R scripts used in the workshop.

The goal of the workshop is to serve as a practical guide for trade policy analysis with the structural gravity model, i.e., the workhorse model in international trade. The course traces the evolution of the gravity model from its initial a-theoretical applications to the most recent structural developments, e.g., dynamic gravity, and it offers a comprehensive and balanced approach between theory and empirics.
